1) Install Bugzilla

2) Create symlinks, then run the standalone server:

  perl script/bugz_setup.pl /path/to/bugzilla
  perl script/bugz_server.pl -d

https isn't supported by Catalyst's standalone server, so you'll have to either
use a real deployment mechanism (e.g. reverse proxy or fastcgi) or tunnel over
ssh or something.
